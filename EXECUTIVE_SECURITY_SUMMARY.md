**Business Risk:** **CATASTROPHIC** - Complete compromise of system security, data breach, and potential lateral movement within network infrastructure.

**Mitigation Required:** **IMMEDIATE** - Implement production-grade cryptographic authentication before any deployment.

### **2. BUFFER OVERFLOW VULNERABILITIES (CVSS 9.1 - CRITICAL)**
**Impact:** Kernel memory corruption leading to system crashes, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

**Vulnerability:** Insufficient bounds checking in client context parsing allows attackers to corrupt kernel memory.

**Business Risk:** **SEVERE** - System instability, data corruption, potential for complete system takeover.

**Mitigation Required:** **IMMEDIATE** - Implement comprehensive bounds checking and input validation.

### **3. USE-AFTER-FREE VULNERABILITIES (CVSS 9.0 - CRITICAL)**
**Impact:** Kernel memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution.

**Vulnerability:** Improper memory management in connection state handling creates use-after-free conditions.

**Business Risk:** **SEVERE** - System compromise, privilege escalation, persistent access.

**Mitigation Required:** **IMMEDIATE** - Implement secure memory management with reference counting.
